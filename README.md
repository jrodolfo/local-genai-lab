Local-first GenAI lab for building and testing tool-assisted chat workflows.
Not just a chatbot UI.

This project combines a React frontend, a Spring Boot orchestration backend, local and managed model providers, persistent session memory, and MCP-backed AWS tooling in one full-stack repository.

## Why This Matters

Most LLM demos stop at chat. This project explores how to connect models to real systems.

It focuses on:

- tool-assisted chat with backend-side orchestration instead of direct frontend-to-model calls
- provider abstraction with Ollama by default and Amazon Bedrock as an optional runtime
- persistent session memory with resume, search, filter, import, and export flows
- MCP-backed local tool execution for AWS audits, reports, and artifact generation
- structured report rendering, artifact preview, streaming responses, and API observability

## Architecture

High-level interaction flows:

```text
React -> Spring Boot
          |-> MCP -> Shell Scripts -> AWS CLI -> Report artifacts
          |-> Prompt enrichment with tool result -> Ollama / Bedrock
```

In the successful tool-assisted path, the backend:

1. receives the user message
2. decides a tool is needed
3. calls the MCP-backed tool
4. gets structured tool output back
5. builds an augmented prompt with that tool context
6. sends that enriched prompt to Ollama or Bedrock

Primary chat path:

```text
React Frontend -> Spring Boot Backend -> Ollama or Bedrock
```

Tool-assisted chat path:

```text
React Frontend -> Spring Boot Backend -> Local MCP Server -> Shell Scripts -> AWS CLI / report artifacts -> Spring Boot Backend prompt enrichment -> Ollama or Bedrock
```

Immediate backend response path:

```text
React Frontend -> Spring Boot Backend -> clarification or tool-failure response
```

## Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Maven 3.9+
- Node 20+
- Ollama installed locally for the default provider
- Docker + Docker Compose, optional
- AWS CLI v2 + `jq` + valid AWS credentials, only for AWS shell tools and local MCP-backed report flows

## Quick Start

### 1. Pull a local model

```bash
ollama pull llama3:8b
ollama run llama3:8b
```

Ollama should be reachable at `http://localhost:11434`.

### 2. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Backend URLs:

- API root: `http://localhost:8080`
- OpenAPI: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
- Health: `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`
- Info: `http://localhost:8080/actuator/info`

`GET /actuator` redirects to `/actuator/health`. Swagger excludes `/actuator/**` so the generated API docs stay focused on the application API.

### 3. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend URL:

- `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Optional: build the local MCP server

```bash
cd mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

MCP is enabled by default in the backend. To run without it, set `MCP_ENABLED=false`.

## Docker

Keep Ollama running on the host first, then:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- backend: `http://localhost:8080`

## Configuration Overview

The most important backend settings are:

- `APP_MODEL_PROVIDER` default: `ollama`
- `OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODEL` default: `llama3:8b`
- `BEDROCK_REGION` default: `us-east-1`
- `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` default: empty
- `MCP_ENABLED` default: `true`
- `APP_TOOLS_ROUTING_MODE` default: `hybrid`
- `APP_STORAGE_SESSIONS_DIRECTORY` default: `data/sessions`
- `APP_STORAGE_REPORTS_DIRECTORY` default: `scripts/reports`

The storage defaults are resolved from the project root so they stay stable whether the backend starts from `backend/` or the repository root.
You can also point `APP_STORAGE_REPORTS_DIRECTORY` to an absolute path outside the repository if you want report artifacts stored elsewhere.

## Main Features

### Chat and Providers

- normal and streaming chat endpoints
- Ollama as the default provider
- Amazon Bedrock as an optional provider
- provider metadata in responses and saved session history
- typed JSON SSE events for streaming chat

### Sessions

- local JSON-backed conversation memory
- generated session titles and summaries
- session sidebar with search and filters
- JSON and Markdown export
- JSON import with collision-safe session ids
- backend-managed opaque session ids with strict validation

### Tools and Artifacts

- local MCP-backed AWS audit and reporting flows
- LLM-assisted tool routing with fallback
- multi-turn clarification for missing tool inputs
- structured report cards in the UI
- read-only artifact preview and file listing under `scripts/reports/`

Artifact API note:

- the configured reports directory may be inside or outside the repository
- artifact endpoints accept only paths relative to that configured reports directory
- absolute artifact paths are rejected intentionally so the backend keeps a strict read-only boundary

## Shell Scripts

The shell tooling lives under [`scripts/`](./scripts). Useful entrypoints:

```bash
cd scripts
make help
make check-app
make test
make audit
make s3-cloudwatch BUCKET=example.com
```

`make check-app` verifies backend, frontend, and Ollama availability with sensible local defaults.

## Documentation Map

- [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md): backend API, provider config, MCP integration, Actuator, sessions, Bedrock notes
- [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md): frontend-specific details
- [scripts/README.md](./scripts/README.md): shell tooling, report formats, smoke checks
- [mcp/README.md](./mcp/README.md): local MCP server details

## Current Scope

- single-user, local-first GenAI lab for hands-on learning and AWS Generative AI Developer Professional exam preparation
- optimized for correctness, inspectability, and local workflow clarity rather than multi-user scale
- intended to run on a developer machine with local Ollama, optional Bedrock access, and optional MCP-backed AWS tooling

## Known Limitations

- not designed as a multi-tenant or internet-facing production service
- MCP tool execution currently uses short-lived local subprocesses, which is acceptable for this local lab but not tuned for shared high-concurrency use
- backend health/readiness is backend-only; whole-stack local checks still belong to `scripts/check-app.sh`
- artifact access is intentionally read-only and bounded to the configured reports directory
- Bedrock and AWS tool flows depend on your local AWS credentials and runtime environment being configured correctly
- some operational choices favor simple local behavior over production-style resilience, especially around local process orchestration and developer-machine assumptions

## Notes for Heavier Models

- `codellama:70b` is optional and not the recommended first-run default
- larger local models can be much slower and more memory intensive
- if you use a heavier model, you may need to raise backend read timeouts
