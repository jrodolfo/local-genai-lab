Shell-based AWS audit helper for checking common resources across AWS regions, defaulting to `us-east-1` and `us-east-2`.

The repo also includes a focused S3 CloudWatch script for inspecting one bucket's storage and request metrics.

It is designed for a practical cleanup workflow:
- compare resources across one or more regions
- spot likely billable resources first
- keep raw command output for later inspection
- continue running even when some AWS services, permissions, or endpoints fail

## What It Produces

Each regional audit run writes a timestamped folder under `reports/audit/`, for example:

```text
reports/audit/aws-audit-2026-04-06_16-34-25/
```

Each S3 CloudWatch run writes a timestamped folder under `reports/s3-cloudwatch/`, for example:

```text
reports/s3-cloudwatch/s3-cloudwatch-2026-04-06_20-35-38/
```

That folder contains:
- `report.txt`: human-readable summary and detailed results
- `summary.json`: machine-readable run summary with counts and failed/skipped commands
- `json/`: raw JSON outputs for successful JSON commands
- `text/`: raw text outputs for text-based commands
- `stderr/`: stderr captured from failed commands
- `meta/status.tsv`: machine-readable command status metadata

The `reports/` directory is ignored by Git so audit output does not get committed.

## Requirements

- macOS or another Bash-compatible environment
- AWS CLI v2
- `jq`
- valid AWS credentials

## Usage

Run the audit:

```bash
make audit
```

Run the audit for specific regions through `make`:

```bash
make audit REGIONS="us-east-2"
```

Or:

```bash
make audit REGIONS="us-east-1 us-east-2"
```

Limit the audit to specific service groups:

```bash
make audit SERVICES="sagemaker ec2"
```

Run the script directly with the default regions:

```bash
./aws-region-audit-report.sh
```

Override the regions:

```bash
./aws-region-audit-report.sh --regions us-east-1 us-east-2
```

Or:

```bash
./aws-region-audit-report.sh --regions us-east-1,us-east-2
```

Filter by service groups:

```bash
./aws-region-audit-report.sh --services sagemaker,ec2
```

Service filter keys:
- `sts`
- `aws-config`
- `s3`
- `ec2`
- `elbv2`
- `rds`
- `lambda`
- `ecs`
- `eks`
- `sagemaker`
- `opensearch`
- `secretsmanager`
- `logs`
- `tagging`

Run local tests:

```bash
make test
```

Check script syntax:

```bash
make lint
```

## CI

GitHub Actions runs CI for pushes to `main` and for pull requests.

The default CI workflow runs:
- `make lint`
- `make test`

These checks are local and mock-based, so they do not require AWS credentials.

Show available targets:

```bash
make help
```

Check whether the local app stack is up:

```bash
make check-app
```

Optional overrides:

```bash
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080 FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 CHECK_OLLAMA=false make check-app
```

Run the S3 CloudWatch bucket report:

```bash
make s3-cloudwatch BUCKET=example.com
```

Override the request-metrics region:

```bash
make s3-cloudwatch BUCKET=example.com REGION=us-east-2
```

Override the queried time window:

```bash
make s3-cloudwatch BUCKET=example.com DAYS=30
```

## AWS Services Covered

The script currently checks:
- STS
- S3
- EC2 instances
- EBS volumes
- Elastic IPs
- VPCs
- subnets
- security groups
- ELBv2
- RDS
- Lambda
- ECS
- EKS
- SageMaker domains
- SageMaker notebook instances
- OpenSearch
- Secrets Manager
- CloudWatch Logs
- Resource Groups Tagging API

## S3 CloudWatch Script

Use [`aws-s3-cloudwatch-report.sh`](./aws-s3-cloudwatch-report.sh) when you want a CloudWatch-focused report for one bucket.

Example:

```bash
./aws-s3-cloudwatch-report.sh --bucket example.com
```

Query a longer time window:

```bash
./aws-s3-cloudwatch-report.sh --bucket example.com --days 30
```

The script:
- detects the bucket region
- queries S3 storage metrics from CloudWatch in `us-east-1`
- queries bucket request metrics from the bucket region
- writes a readable `report.txt`
- writes a machine-readable `summary.json`
- saves raw JSON and stderr details under `reports/s3-cloudwatch/`

Notes for S3 metrics:
- storage metrics such as `BucketSizeBytes` and `NumberOfObjects` are daily metrics
- request metrics may not exist unless S3 request metrics are enabled for the bucket
- a static website bucket is a good fit for checking request counts, errors, bytes downloaded, and object counts

## Notes

- Regional commands use explicit `--region` values.
- The default regions are `us-east-1` and `us-east-2`, but you can override them with `--regions`.
- `make audit` also accepts `REGIONS="..."` and `SERVICES="..."` and passes them through to the script.
- `make s3-cloudwatch` accepts `BUCKET=...` and optional `REGION=...` and `DAYS=...`.
- Skipped commands are recorded explicitly when you use `--services`.
- The script is intentionally defensive and continues after individual command failures.
- If AWS permissions are missing or a service is unavailable, the failure is recorded in the report and under `stderr/`.
